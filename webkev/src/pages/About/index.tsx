        Hey there ðŸ‘‹
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks for having a look at my cool ðŸ¤™ coder guy ðŸ¤™ website.
        <br />I mostly built it for fun to play around with a bunch of services
        and things I'd not touched yet (Pulumi IAC is the cool new toy at the
        mo) so I hope you like my <strong>totally original</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>not at all copied</strong> design.
        <br />
        Maybe one day I'll add some blog-y style posts detailing how it all
        happens (obviously it's completely overengineered).
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyway, I'm Kevin and I'm a software engineer currently working at{" "}
        <a href="https://whereby.com">Whereby</a>. I do some other stuff too,
        like play music, travel a bunch, generally fret about the state of the
        world and how it's slightly on fire. You know, normal stuff.
