# WebKev

This is the [Preact](https://preactjs.com) frontend, nothing special really, all the fun stuff happens when we deploy it.

It uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime/dep manager for funsies and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to build.

## dev
Install Bun, clone this repo and run `bun install` to get the dependencies.

`bun dev` will start the development server, but the contact form won't work ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

## testing

err... maybe one day

## deployment

See the kevfrastructure module

## TODO

- blog maybe?
- DIY analytics?
