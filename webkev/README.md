# `WebKev`

This is a Preact SSR (for now? Mabye?) app that just shows some info about me for now.

Dreams include but are not limited to:
- themes
- expanded experience section with a more in-depth description on the right in _another_ sidebar
- maybe some personal project stuff? Cassette if it ever happens?
- Maybe write it all in markdown and parse/render it as 'code'
